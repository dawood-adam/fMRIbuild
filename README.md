# niBuild

To streamline the process of creating fMRI and other neuro-imaging analysis workflows, 
we've developed niBuild. Through the graphical user interface (GUI) users can design workflows 
leveraging analysis operations from FSL, AFNI, ANTs, FreeSurfer, etc. After designing the workflow 
users can directly generate a workflow zip package containing the 
[Common Workflow Language (CWL)](https://www.commonwl.org/user_guide/introduction/index.html) workflow 
along with its tool dependencies. This project aims to alleviate aspects of the reproducibility crisis in 
image analysis by facilitating creation of shareable and reusable workflows. 

### [Deployment](https://kunaalagarwal.github.io/niBuild/)

### Running Locally

Clone the repository, install the dependencies, and start the development server:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KunaalAgarwal/niBuild.git
cd niBuild
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Contributions

When contributing, please follow these best practices:

- **Use Development Branches:**  
  Create a new local branch for each feature or bug fix. Make all changes in that branch and test thoroughly, 
see utils directory for testing harness. Creating a local branch allows for development of novel changes without 
triggering an automatic deployment.

  ```bash
  git checkout -b <branch_name>
  ```
  
- **Merging to Main:**  
  Once your changes have been tested and are stable in the development environment, create a pull request
to merge them into the `main` branch. The PR will then be reviewed and upon approval by one of the repository managers the
changes will be merged into `main` and subsequently released into production.
  **Important:** The repository is configured with GitHub Actions to automatically deploy to GitHub Pages on every push to the `main` branch.
  ```bash
  git checkout main
  git merge <branch_name> -m "Merge <branch_name>: commit message"
  git push origin main
  ```

### Deployment Workflow

Our deployment process uses GitHub Actions to automatically build and deploy the 
project whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch. This ensures that the live site on GitHub 
Pages is always up-to-date with the latest stable code.

### Authorship

This project was created by Kunaal Agarwal, Adam Dawood and advised by Javier Rasero, PhD, under the funding of the University of Virginia Harrison Research Award.
